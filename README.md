# iOS App Task Documentation: Movies Screen

## Introduction

This document outlines the development and implementation of the Movies Screen feature in our iOS application. The Movies Screen displays a list of movies to users, utilizing the MVVM-Coordinator architecture, SwiftUI for the user interface, and Combine for reactive programming. Additionally, we have implemented our own networking classes using Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP) principles and dependency injection to ensure testability.

## Architecture Overview

### MVVM-Coordinator Architecture

The MVVM-Coordinator architecture separates concerns into different layers:
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Presents the user interface and binds to ViewModel properties.
- **ViewModel**: Mediates between the View and the Model, handling user interactions and providing data for display.
- **Coordinator**: Coordinates navigation and flow between different screens of the application.

### SwiftUI and Combine

- **SwiftUI**: Declarative framework for building user interfaces. We use SwiftUI to define the UI components and their interactions.
- **Combine**: Apple's framework for reactive programming. Combine enables us to handle asynchronous events and data streams in a declarative manner.

## Implementation Details

### Networking

We have implemented our own networking classes using Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP) principles. This approach allows us to define protocols for different network-related tasks and provide implementations accordingly. Dependency injection is utilized to inject the appropriate networking service instances into other components, making them testable.

### Movies Screen

The Movies Screen consists of the following components:

- **ViewModel**: The `HomeViewModel` mediates between the View and the Model. It interacts with the networking layer to fetch movie data and exposes properties for the View to bind to.
- **View**: Defined using SwiftUI, the Movies Screen View presents the user interface elements and binds to the ViewModel properties. It displays the list of movies retrieved from the ViewModel.
- **Coordinator**: Responsible for coordinating navigation to and from the Movies Screen. It handles the presentation of the Movies Screen and any other necessary navigation logic.

## Unit Testing

We have implemented unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of our code:
- **ViewModel Tests**: Unit tests are written for the `HomeViewModel` to verify its behavior in different scenarios, such as loading movies successfully and handling errors.
- **MoviesAPIData Tests**: Unit tests are written for the `MoviesAPIData` protocol to ensure that the correct data is returned and errors are handled appropriately by conforming types.
